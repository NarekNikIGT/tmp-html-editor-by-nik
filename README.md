Text Mesh Pro HTML tags editor by Narek Nik Hovsepyan

The TMP HTML editor allows you to insert HTML tags into your text without HTML knowledge.

One text can contain many tags, for example. The first step is to select the color, then add the size tag and something else. The editor will apply all the changes you make to the text.
